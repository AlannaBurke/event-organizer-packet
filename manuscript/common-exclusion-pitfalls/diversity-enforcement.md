# Diversity Enforcement

Having a Code of Conduct is a wonderful first step in providing for a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive environment for Speakers, Volunteers, and Attendees.

An example of unintentional exclusion occurs when it comes to *enforcing* your DrupalCamp’s Code of Conduct and Commitment to Diversity. When posting your Event’s Code of Conduct, be sure to include a Point of Contact for any infractions.

Participants should have a way to report when they have been made uncomfortable **and** a known Point of Contact for removing non-compliance Staff/Attendees. By presenting a willingness to not only promote, but *enforce* Diversity, Accessibility, and Inclusion, Participants will feel more comfortable at your DrupalCamp.
