# Diversity Enforcement

Having a Code of Conduct is a wonderful first step in providing for a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive environment for speakers, volunteers, and attendees.

An example of unintentional exclusion occurs when it comes to *enforcing* your DrupalCamp’s Code of Conduct and commitment to diversity. When posting your event’s Code of Conduct, be sure to include a point of contact for any infractions.

Participants should have a way to report when they have been made uncomfortable **and** a known point of contact for removing non-compliant staff/attendees. By presenting a willingness to not only promote, but *enforce* diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion, participants will feel more comfortable at your Drupal event.  

Be overly communicative about your code of conduct. Let attendees know about it in marketing emails. Make them agree to it when they buy tickets. Have slides in your opening session deck that reminds attendees of the code of conduct, as well as who to speak to. Remind them that they should report anything that they see, as well as anything they experience. 

Make sure that the people you designate to receive code of conduct reports have been trained to receive them. [Sage Sharp of Otter Technology](https://otter.technology/) does a great training. Also, have more than one person designated to receive reports, preferably of different genders/backgrounds. This way, attendees will be able to choose the person they feel most comfortable with to speak to should the need arise. 

Encourage speakers to include a slide about the code of conduct and points of contact in their deck.
