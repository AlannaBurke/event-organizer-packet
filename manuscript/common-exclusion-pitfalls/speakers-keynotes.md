# Speakers & Keynotes

The most common question event organizers ask is **"how can we get more diverse speakers?"** 

The answer:

**Do the work.**

## Outreach
* Research groups in your area to reach out to. 
* Considering hiring someone who is experienced in this area to help with outreach. 

## Goals
* Set aside a specific number or percent of your sessions for speakers who identify with underrepresented groups. 

## Data
* Make sure that you are gathering attendee/speaker demographic data, so that you can track your goals. A great resource for what to gather can be found at [Open Demographics](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics).
