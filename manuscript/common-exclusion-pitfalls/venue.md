# Venue

Things to consider when choosing Venues for your Camp, Conference, After Party, or even the Local Attractions:

## Accessibility
When choosing Venues, especially for Event locations, try and ensure buildings meet ADA Compliance Standards.

* Mobility
  * Have few stairs, and have alternatives to support all potential Attendees. Doors or entrances that are easily opened (maybe wide, maybe automatic). Consider those that can't walk (wheelchairs), those with difficulty walking, those who have pain while walking or standing. Not all disabilities are visible.
  
* Sight
  * Signs with braille. Have volunteers at intersections to give directions.
  
* Moving lanes
  * Keep moving lanes clear of people standing and blocking the way. It can be tiring or painful (emotionally and physically) to be blocked from moving, to ask for special treatment, and to often say "Excuse me".
  * Painters tape (low adhesive tape easily removed) to mark travel lanes through hallways and seating areas help remind people to step out of the way to stop and chat. On website, at opening, in program, explain the tape and moving lane purpose.   
* Time moving during a walk through
  * Communicate before or when tickets are available what the travel times are from arrival (train, bus, parking) to registration and the first session. This helps people know if they will be able to navigate the venue at the same time they need to invest money in a ticket. 
  * Do not assume that people will buy a ticket without this information. During planning and after, publish information related to acessibility. This will increase the turnout for the next event.

* Bathrooms
  * Inquire with venue, or note during walk through where the bathrooms are, which are wheelchair accessible, which are gendered, which are not gendered. Publish this information early with other venue info, before or at the time tickets become available.
* Cost
  * Though not commonly thought of as a method of exclusion, the overall Cost of the Venue (Parking Fees, Hotel Costs, Airfare, Cover Charges at After Parties, etc.) can be an unintentional method of exclusion. Try Corporate Sponsorship if costs may affect Diversity.

## Services and Amenities
  * Food
    * Label everything. Include ingredients.
    * Prefer assemblable food (where each ingredient is labeled, and people pick which to combine). Example: baked potato and topings, tacos, salads
  * Quite room
  * Speaker room
  * Loud room (like for kids or game playing)
  * Childcare
  * Private space with refrigeration for pumping breastmilk or dealing with mediation
  * Translation
    * Verbal
    * ASL
  * Live captioning
