# Venue

Things to consider when choosing Venues for your Camp, Conference, After Party, or even the Local Attractions:

1. Accessibility - When choosing Venues, especially for Event locations, try and ensure buildings meet ADA Compliance Standards, have few stairs, or have alternatives to support all potential Attendees.

2. Cost - Though not commonly thought of as a method of exclusion, the overall Cost of the Venue (Parking Fees, Hotel Costs, Airfare, Cover Charges at After Parties, etc.) can be an unintentional method of exclusion. Try Corporate Sponsorship if costs may affect Diversity.

3. Services and Amenities -
  a. Food
    i. Label everything. Include ingredients.
    ii. Prefer assemblable food (where each ingredient is labeled, and people pick which to combine). Example: baked potato and topings, tacos, salads
  b. Quite room
  c. Speaker room
  d. Loud room (like for kids or game playing)
  e. Childcare
  f. Private space with refrigeration for pumping breastmilk or dealing with mediation
  g. Translation
    i. Verbal
    ii. ASL
  h. Live captioning
