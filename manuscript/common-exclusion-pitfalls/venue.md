# Venue

Things to consider when choosing venues for your camp, conference, after party, or even local attractions to suggest:

## Accessibility
When choosing venues, especially for event locations, try to ensure buildings meet ADA compliance standards.

### Mobility
* Have few stairs, and have alternatives to support all potential attendees. Doors or entrances that are easily opened (thik wide, automatic). Consider those who can't walk (wheelchairs), those with difficulty walking, those who have pain while walking or standing. Not all disabilities are visible.
  
### Sight
* Signs with braille. 
* Have volunteers at intersections to give directions. 
* Have clear, high-contrast signage in large font.
  
### Moving lanes
* Keep moving lanes clear of people standing and blocking the way. It can be tiring or painful (emotionally and physically) to be blocked from moving, to ask for special treatment, and to often say "Excuse me."
* Painters tape (low adhesive tape easily removed) to mark travel lanes through hallways and seating areas help remind people to step out of the way to stop and chat. On website, at opening, in program, explain the tape and moving lane purpose.   
### Time moving during a walk through
* Communicate before or when tickets are available what the travel times are from arrival (train, bus, parking) to registration and the first session. This helps people know if they will be able to navigate the venue at the same time they need to invest money in a ticket. 
* Do not assume that people will buy a ticket without this information. During planning and after, publish information related to accessibility. This will increase the turnout for the next event.

### Bathrooms
* Inquire with venue, or note during walk through:
     * Where the bathrooms are.
     * Which are wheelchair accessible.
     * Which are gendered.
     * Which are not gendered.
  * Publish this information early with other venue info, before or at the time tickets become available.

### Cost
* Though not commonly thought of as a method of exclusion, the overall cost of the venue (parking fees, hotel costs, Airfare, Cover Charges at After Parties, etc.) can be an unintentional method of exclusion. Try corporate sponsorship if costs may affect diversity.

### Services and Amenities
  #### Food
  * Label everything. Include ingredients.
  * Try to provide food that can be assembled (where each ingredient is labeled, and people pick which to combine). Example: baked potato and toppings, tacos, salads.
  #### Quiet room
  * A stimulation-free zone with low lighting, no talking. People can relax, meditate, do yoga, color, read, etc. 

  #### Speaker prep room
  * A room set aside for speakers to prep for their sessions. A fairly quiet room, with power and tables to sit. 
  * Provide water, coffee, snacks. 

  #### Prayer room
  * This should be a separate space from a general quiet room, only for those who need it for prayer. 

  #### Loud room (like for kids or game playing)
  * A place for those who need to relax in a different way.
  *  Provide some board games.
  * Ideally where folks who bring their kids by to visit go hang out so they don't disturb others. 

  #### Childcare
  * A lack of childcare is a huge barrier for many who want to attend events. It can be expensive, but it makes a huge difference. Do everything you can to provide it. Look into finding a corporate sponsor specifically for childcare. Be aware of any legal issues around on-site childcare. 

  #### Private space with refrigeration for pumping breastmilk or storing medication

  #### Translation
  * Verbal
  * ASL
  * Live captioning
