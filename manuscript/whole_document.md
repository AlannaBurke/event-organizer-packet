THE BIG GOAL

Provide a resource with actionable items for camp organizers to create a more diverse and inclusive camp.  

### Objectives

After reading this, camp organizers should be able to:

* identify strategies they can use to increase diversity at their camp

* identify possible roadblocks to minority participation (wording)

* identify common pitfalls that can make camps feel less inclusive

* communicate their diversity and inclusion goals to their volunteer team

* implement a [code of conduct](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/code-conduct) for their camp

# Introduction

# Diversity Goals

As with all projects and activities, setting goals up front assists in helping Event Contributors (Organizers, Volunteers, etc.) when making decisions affecting the overall event.

## Example Diversity Goals

# Code of Conduct

Event Organizers are encouraged to reference the Code of Conduct often and post the Camp’s Code of Conduct in an easily readable format on their site.

## Drupal Code of Conduct

The Drupal Code of Conduct ([https://www.drupal.org/dcoc](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc)) defines the shared ideals of the Drupal Community for the people within the Community.   

1. [Be considerate.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#consideration)

2. [Be respectful.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#respect)

3. [Be collaborative.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#collaboration)

4. [When we disagree, we consult others.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#conflict-resolution)

5. [When we are unsure, we ask for help.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#ask-for-help)

6. [Step down considerately.](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc#stepping-down)

The Drupal Code of Conduct is a great start for establishing a solid behavioral standard for the Drupal Community. As Event Organizers running a Drupal Camp or Event, further steps should be taken to *actively* promote Diversity within your Camp’s Code of Conduct.

Remind everyone why they

**Come for the software, stay for the community.**

## Example Code of Conduct

(Large parts referenced from [https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/code-conduct](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/code-conduct) )

### *Code of Conduct*

*DrupalCamp brings together people from around the world who use, develop, design, and support the Drupal platform. Many attendees at DrupalCamp are newcomers evaluating both our platform and our community.The Drupal Code of Conduct (**[http://drupal.org/dco*c](http://drupal.org/dcoc)*) outlines our shared ideals and values. This document expresses how we hope to make these ideals real at our conferences and other events. Our goal is to ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment that encourages and inspires mutual respect and collaboration.*

### *Come for the software, stay for the community*

*Drupal would simply not exist without its community. We want all attendees at DrupalCamp to have an awesome experience, both in and out of formal conference sessions. The purpose of this document is not to restrict the diversity of ideas and expression in the Drupal Community; rather, it's to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could alienate valuable members — and potential members — of the community.*

### *We are considerate*

*DrupalCamp is an event that attracts diverse people from a wide variety of ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to consider both the impact of their actions on those with different backgrounds and experiences and the honest intentions of those who may have unknowingly caused offense.*

### *We are welcoming*

*One of the greatest strengths of the Drupal community is our inclusiveness. Making all attendees feel welcome and included at DrupalCamp is everyone’s job, including exhibitors and sponsors.*

### *We are respectful*

*Sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants should strive to treat all people with dignity and respect, regardless of their culture, religion, physical appearance, disability, race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.*

### *We are collaborative*

*If and when misunderstandings occur, we encourage people to work things out between themselves whenever possible. People are encouraged to take responsibility for their words and actions and listen to constructively-presented criticism with an open mind, courtesy, and respect.*

### *When we disagree, we consult others*

*If people are unable to work out issues between themselves, they are encouraged to seek the advice of a mutually trusted third party or a designated community volunteer to help mediate.You may contact the Drupal Community Working Group to help mediate or resolve issues via email at drupal-cwg@drupal.org or with an online incident report.*

### *When we need it, we ask for help*

*We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. If you feel threatened or violated as a result of intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct, please immediately notify a conference staff member. Likewise, please immediately notify a staff member if you notice that someone else is being subjected to such behavior.The DrupalCon team wants everyone to feel safe for the duration of the conference. If necessary, conference staff are empowered to take appropriate actions that may include, but are not limited to, warnings, expulsion from the conference without refund, and referrals to venue security or local law enforcement.*

### *We’re all in this together*

*Thanks for making DrupalCon awesome for everyone!The DrupalCamp Code of Conduct is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and is available for others to use and adapt for their own events.*

### *Help, Community*

*Our DrupalCamp email is [insert email here].*

*For immediate assistance or to report a Code of Conduct violation during the event, please find a volunteer and ask to speak with [Lead Volunteer / Organizer].*

*(For Camps Live-Streaming a Monitored Twitter Feed)*

*Help from the Drupal Community is available at our DrupalCamp at hashtag #[insert-here].*

# Common Exclusion Pitfalls

## Venue

Things to consider when choosing Venues for your Camp, Conference, After Party, or even the Local Attractions:

1. Accessibility - When choosing Venues, especially for Event locations, try and ensure buildings meet ADA Compliance Standards, have few stairs, or have alternatives to support all potential Attendees.

2. Cost - Though not commonly thought of as a method of exclusion, the overall Cost of the Venue (Parking Fees, Hotel Costs, Airfare, Cover Charges at After Parties, etc.) can be an unintentional method of exclusion. Try Corporate Sponsorship if costs may affect Diversity.

3. Services and Amenities -

## Verbiage

## Speakers & Keynotes

## Diversity Enforcement

Having a Code of Conduct is a wonderful first step in providing for a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive environment for Speakers, Volunteers, and Attendees.

An example of unintentional exclusion occurs when it comes to *enforcing* your DrupalCamp’s Code of Conduct and Commitment to Diversity. When posting your Event’s Code of Conduct, be sure to include a Point of Contact for any infractions.

Participants should have a way to report when they have been made uncomfortable **and** a known Point of Contact for removing non-compliance Staff/Attendees. By presenting a willingness to not only promote, but *enforce* Diversity, Accessibility, and Inclusion, Participants will feel more comfortable at your DrupalCamp.  

# Diversity Inclusion Strategies

# Communicating Inclusion



* could camps feature companies that are specifically working to hire diverse employees?

* could camps provide *resources* for companies desiring to be more diverse in their hiring?
