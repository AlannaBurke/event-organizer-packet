# Diversity Inclusion Strategies
Last updated on 01 February 2020.

## Goal

Outlines specific actions that you, as the event organizer, can take to make the event day(s) as inclusive as possible.  

## Organizing Team 
Diversity starts with your organizing team. You need a diverse group of people to come up with ideas to bring in a diverse group of speakers and cater to a diverse group of attendees. This is step zero. Make sure that you have recruited an empathetic, educated, enthusiastic, organizing team from a variety of backgrounds. This will also assure your attendees and speakers that you have some understanding of their needs because you have a shared lived experience.

## Food and Drink

### Inclusive Catering
The [AdaCamp Inclusive Catering guide](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/inclusive-event-catering/) is a robust workup of everything involved in catering for diverse groups.  However, it's also an expensive proposition.  

When money is a consideration, we recommend first addressing those attendees with restrictions because of allergies or religious beliefs. If only one type of meal can be served, for example, serve a vegan/gluten-free/kosher/halal meal that everyone can enjoy. No one will be harmed by the lack of ingredients and everyone will have their dietary needs met. This is an example, make sure you are meeting the specific dietary needs of your attendees.

### Caution with Alcohol

Much has been written about the role of alcohol at technology events, and [AdaCamp](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/) gathers many of the links here.  The easiest solution to make an event and event attendees safe from the dangers of conference drinking is to not incentivize alcohol at any official events.  This means no alcohol sponsors, no after-parties at breweries, no kegs in the conference hall.

Alcohol at events excludes many - those who do not drink for religious reasons, because they are sober, for personal reasons, and because they are under-age! Eliminating alcohol opens up your event to a wider audience, which is much more inclusive. 

Consider _at least_ holding alcohol-free after-parties for those who do not drink. Make them as fun and market them equally with alcohol-centered events.

### Live captioning
Another method of inclusiveness is ensuring Deaf, Hard of Hearing (HOH), etc. attendees at your event are able to experience everything the event has to offer. Hiring interpreter services is one option to do this, but a better option - and an option that benefits everyone is real-time captioning, often referred to as CART, short for "Computer Assisted Real Time Transcription". [A great write up of real-time captioning ](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/) demonstrates how it benefits more than d/Deaf/HoH attendees and also provides transcripts of talks.

Washington.edu provides an enlightening description as well, including a link to a post on "where to find in your area" ( http://www.washington.edu/doit/what-real-time-captioning ) from dmcp.org with a gathered list of available (and Department of Education certified) Vendors: https://dcmp.org/ai/10/

The event organizer can also explore the following list of free captioning tools gathered by the National Center for Accessible Media: http://ncam.wgbh.org/invent_build/web_multimedia/tools-guidelines

One more option, though imperfect, is to use the [closed captioning tool in Google Slides](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9109474?hl=en) when presenting. It will automaticlaly create captions as you speak. The downside is that they're obviously not perfect and the font is rather small, but they can be made available later on a saved video. However, they cannot be edited like captions added to a YouTube video can be.
