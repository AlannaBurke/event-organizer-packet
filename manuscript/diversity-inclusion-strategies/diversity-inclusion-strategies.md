# Diversity Inclusion Strategies
Last updated on 18 January 2017

## Goal

Outlines specific actions that you, as the Event Organizer, can take to make the event day(s) as inclusive as possible.  

## Venue / Food / Non-conference items

### Gender-neutral restrooms
[AdaCamp Gender Neutral Restroom guide](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/gender-neutral-restrooms/)

Make the organizing team as diverse as possible (almost step zero? maybe this fits better somewhere else but it does seem important to me)
Provide live captioning

### Inclusive Catering
The [AdaCamp Inclusive Catering guide](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/inclusive-event-catering/) is a robust workup of everything involved in catering for diverse groups.  However, it's also an expensive proposition.  

When money is a consideration, we recommend first addressing those attendees with restrictions because of allergies or religious beliefs. (@todo - is this what we recommend?)

### Caution with Alcohol

Much has been written about the role of alcohol at technology events, and [AdaCamp](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/) gathers many of the links here.  The easiest solution to make an event and event attendees safe from the dangers of conference drinking is to not incentivize alcohol at any official events.  This means no alcohol sponsors, no after-parties at breweries, no kegs in the conference hall.

## Conference items

### Live captioning
Another method of inclusiveness is ensuring Deaf, Hard of Hearing (HOH), etc. attendees at your event are able to experience everything the event has to offer. Hiring interpreter services is one option to do this, but a better option - and an option that benefits everyone is real-time captioning, often referred to as CART, short for "Computer Assisted Real Time Transcription".   [A great write up of real-time captioning ](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/) demonstrates how it benefits more than d/Deaf/HoH attendees and also provides transcripts of talks.

Washington.edu provides an enlightening description as well, including a link to a post on "where to find in your area" ( http://www.washington.edu/doit/what-real-time-captioning ) from dmcp.org with a gathered list of available (and Department of Education Certified) Vendors: https://dcmp.org/ai/10/

Finally, the Event Organizer can explore the following list of free Captioning Tools gathered by the National Center for Accessible Media: http://ncam.wgbh.org/invent_build/web_multimedia/tools-guidelines
