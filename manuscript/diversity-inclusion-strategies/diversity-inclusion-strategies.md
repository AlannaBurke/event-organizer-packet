### Gender-neutral restrooms

Make the organizing team as diverse as possible (almost step zero? maybe this fits better somewhere else but it does seem important to me)
Provide live captioning

### Inclusive Catering
The [AdaCamp Inclusive Catering guide](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/inclusive-event-catering/) is a robust workup of everything involved in catering for diverse groups.  However, it's also an expensive proposition.  

When money is a consideration, we recommend first addressing those attendees with restrictions because of allergies or religious beliefs. (@todo - is this what we recommend?)

### Caution with Alcohol

Much has been written about the role of alcohol at technology events, and [AdaCamp](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/) gathers many of the links here.  The easiest solution to make an event and event attendees safe from the dangers of conference drinking is to not incentivize alcohol at any official events.  This means no alcohol sponsors, no after-parties at breweries, no kegs in the conference hall. 

## Conference items

### Live captioning
If you have d/Deaf/HoH attendees at your event, you want to make sure that they have access to everything the event has to offer.  Hiring interpreter services is one option to do this, but a better option - and an option that benefits everyone is real-time captioning.   [A great write up of real-time captioning ](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/) demonstrates how it benefits more than d/Deaf/HoH attendees and also provides transcripts of talks.  

(@todo - how can we help event organizers find captioners in their area?)
